##Prime sifter

####This is a ruby method that returns all of the prime numbers less than the passed in number.

To use it just copy the code from the lib/prime_sifter.rb file and paste it into a ruby client ([Here's a link](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/installing-ruby) that helped me install ruby on my machine). Then type â€˜prime_sifter(your-number-here)' in the client.

We built this project while we were students at [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/). [This exercise](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/legacy-data-conversion-prime-sifting-nth-prime) was meant to introduce us to writing our own ruby methods.
